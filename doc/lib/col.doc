/*  This file describes the col_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide basic conversions between colours in
    different colour spaces.

/*  [PURPOSE] This routine will convert a slice in HSB (Hue, Saturation and
    Brightness) colour space to a 2-dimensional array of RGB (Red, Green and
    Blue) values. The HSB slice covers a range of hue and brightness at a fixed
    satutation.
    <rgb_array> The 256*256 array of RGB values will be written here. The upper
    dimension will map to brightness and the lower dimension will map to hue.
    <red_mask> The bitmask used when writing the red colour component.
    <green_mask> The bitmask used when writing the green colour component.
    <blue_mask> The bitmask used when writing the blue colour component.
    <min_brightness> The minimum brightness. The valid range is 0.0 to 1.0
    <max_brightness> The maximum brightness. The valid range is 0.0 to 1.0
    <start_hue> The start hue. The valid range is 0.0 to just under 6.0
    <stop_hue> The end hue. The valid range is 0.0 to just under 6.0
    <saturation> The saturation value. The valid range is 0.0 to 1.0
    [RETURNS] Nothing.
