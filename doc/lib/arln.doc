/*  This file describes the arln_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a simple to use asynchronous line
    reading facility. When reading from pipes, connections and terminals, the
    routines continue polling for events (using the chm_poll and cm_poll
    routines. Hence, they are not useable in a module which also uses the
    XView notifier.).
