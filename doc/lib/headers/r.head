/*  Low level connection routines  */
/*  This file describes the r_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a low level mechanism to create and
    accept connections. Although these routines are made public, their use is
    NOT recommended. The conn_ package is the suggested means to create and
    accept connections.
