/*  Routines to manipulate simple, n-dimensional data structures  */
/*  This file describes the iarray_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines provide a simple interface to the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma, when only n-dimensional
    data is to be represented.
