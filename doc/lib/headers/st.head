/*  String manipulation routines  */
/*  This file describes the st_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to supplement the standard C library str* routines
    Since each version of Unix has a different set of "extra" string functions,
    this package is meant to bridge the gap, and provides some of the more
    useful "extras".
