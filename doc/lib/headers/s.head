/*  Signal handling routines  */
/*  This file describes the s_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a simplified interface to the Unix
    signal management routines. These routines allow blocking and unblocking
    of signals without the dangers of deadlock (common on multi-threaded
    machines).
    A few "standard" signal handlers are also provided.
