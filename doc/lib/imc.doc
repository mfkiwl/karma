$SUMMARY            Convert a 24 bit truecolour image to an 8 bit pseudocolour image.
$PURPOSE
    Convert a 24 bit truecolour image to an 8 bit pseudocolour image.
$PARAMETER          image_size :
    The size of the image (in pixels).
$PARAMETER          image_reds :
    The red component data of the truecolour image.
$PARAMETER          image_greens :
    The green component data of the truecolour image.
$PARAMETER          image_blues :
    The blue component data of the truecolour image.
$PARAMETER          stride24 :
    The stride (in bytes) between adjacent pixels in the truecolour
    image.
$PARAMETER          out_image :
    The output (8 bit pseudocolour) image data.
$PARAMETER          stride8 :
    The stride (in bytes) between adjacent pixels in the pseudocolour
    image.
$PARAMETER          max_colours :
    The maximum number of unique colours permitted (i.e. the
    maximum colour palette size that can be supported).
$PARAMETER          speed :
    The desired speed of the routine. This value may range from 0 to 9.
    A value of 0 will result in the slowest but highest quality conversion
    (i.e. the routine tries very hard to choose the best colour palette). A
    value of 9 will result in the fastest conversion, at the expense of image
    quality.
$PARAMETER          pack_desc :
    The pointer to the top level packet descriptor of the general
    data structure which contains the colourmap will be written here.
$PARAMETER          packet :
    The pointer to the top level packet of the general data structure
    which contains the colourmap will be written here.
$RETURNS
    TRUE on success, else FALSE.
