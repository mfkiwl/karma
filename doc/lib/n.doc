double n_gaussian ()
/*  This routine will compute a random number with a Gaussian distribution.
    The mean is 0.0 and the variance is 1.0
    The routine will return the number.

double n_uniform ()
/*  This routine will compute a random number with a Uniform distribution.
    The range is from 0.0 to 1.0
    The routine will return the number.
