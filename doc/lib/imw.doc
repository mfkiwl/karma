/*  This file describes the imw_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines provide a means to convert from image data to raw images
    suitable for low level graphics display. Although these routines are made
    public, their use is NOT recommended. The viewimg_ package is the suggested
    means to manage image display.

/*  [PURPOSE] This routine will convert an image from one format to an 8 bit
    image of pixels, maintaining the original image size.
    <out_image> The output image will be written here.
    <out_hstride> The stride between successive horizontal pixels (in bytes).
    <out_vstride> The stride between successive vertical pixels (in bytes).
    <width> The width of the image.
    <height> The height of the image.
    <inp_image> The input image data.
    <inp_hoffsets> The array of horizontal byte offsets.
    <inp_voffsets> The array of vertical byte offsets.
    <inp_type> The type of the input data.
    <conv_type> The input conversion type (when the input is complex).
    <num_pixels> The number of pixels in the pixel array.
    <pixel_values> The array of pixel values.
    <blank_pixel> The pixel value to be used when the intensity value is an
    undefined value.
    <min_sat_pixel> The pixel value to be used when the intensity value is
    below the minimum value.
    <max_sat_pixel> The pixel value to be used when the intensity value is
    above the maximum value.
    <i_min> The minimum intensity value.
    <i_max> The maximum intensity value.
    [RETURNS] TRUE on success, else FALSE.
