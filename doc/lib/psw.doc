PostScriptPage psw_create (Channel channel, double hoffset, double voffset,

/*  This routine will create a PostScriptPage object ready for writing
    PostScript commands to. The routine automatically writes the PostScript
    header.
    The channel to write to must be given by  channel  .
    The horizontal offset (in centimeters) of the co-ordinate origin must be
    given by  hoffset  .
    The vertical offset (in centimeters) of the co-ordinate origin must be
    given by  voffset  .
    The desired horizontal size of the co-ordinate system (in centimeters) must
    be given by  hsize  .
    The desired vertical size of the co-ordinate system (in centimeters) must
    be given by  vsize  .
    If the value of  portrait  is TRUE, objects will be drawn in portrait
    mode (ie. the x-axis will be horizontal), else they will be drawn in
    landscape mode (ie. the x-axis will be vertical).
    NOTE: all subsequent objects drawn must lie in the range (0.0, 0.0) to
    (1.0, 1.0)
    The routine returns a PostScriptPage object on success,
