$SUMMARY          Signal handling routines
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a simplified interface to the Unix
    signal management routines. These routines allow blocking and unblocking
    of signals without the dangers of deadlock (common on multi-threaded
    machines).
    A few "standard" signal handlers are also provided.

$FUNCTION           s_block
$RETURN_TYPE        void
$PARAMETER_LIST
    (int signal)
$SUMMARY            Block a signal.
$PURPOSE
    This routine will cause a signal to be blocked until a subsequent
    call to <-s_unblock-> or <-s_unblock_all->. If the signal is already
    blocked, no action is taken.
$PARAMETER          signal :
    The signal to block.
$RETURNS
    Nothing.
$END

$FUNCTION           s_unblock
$RETURN_TYPE        void
$PARAMETER_LIST
    (int signal)
$SUMMARY            Unblock a signal.
$PURPOSE
    This routine will cause a signal to be unblocked. If the signal
    is not already blocked, no action is taken.
$PARAMETER          signal :
    The signal to unblock.
$NOTE
    The signal will only be unblocked if previously blocked by a call
    to <-s_block->.
$RETURNS
    Nothing.
$END

$FUNCTION           s_unblock_all
$RETURN_TYPE        void
$PARAMETER_LIST
    ()
$SUMMARY            Unblock all signals.
$PURPOSE
    This routine will cause all signals blocked by <-s_block-> to be
    unblocked. If no signals were blocked, no action is taken.
$RETURNS
    Nothing.
$END

$FUNCTION           s_ignore
$RETURN_TYPE        void *
$PARAMETER_LIST
    (int sig)
$SUMMARY            Cause a signal to be ignored.
$PURPOSE
    Cause a signal to be ignored.
$PARAMETER          sig :
    The signal to ignore.
$RETURNS
    The previous signal handler.
$END

$FUNCTION           s_int_handler
$RETURN_TYPE        void
$PARAMETER_LIST
    ()
$SUMMARY            Recommended SIGINT handler.
$PURPOSE
    This routine will handle SIGINT signals (those generated by the
    C shell in response to a control C keypress).
$RETURNS
    Nothing.
$END

$FUNCTION           s_term_handler
$RETURN_TYPE        void
$PARAMETER_LIST
    ()
$SUMMARY            Recommended SIGTERM handler.
$PURPOSE
    This routine will handle SIGTERM signals.
$RETURNS
    Nothing.
$END

$FUNCTION           s_check_for_int
$RETURN_TYPE        flag
$PARAMETER_LIST
    ()
$SUMMARY            Check for queued SIGINTs.
$PURPOSE
    This routine will check if there is a queued interrupt (SIGINT)
    pending.
$RETURNS
    TRUE if there is a queued SIGINT, else FALSE.
