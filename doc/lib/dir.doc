/*  This file describes the dir_ package of routines in the Karma
    library.

    These routines are meant to provide an enhanced, portable method for
    scanning directories and automatically obtaining file status information.

KDir dir_open (CONST char *dirname)
/*  This routine will open a directory for reading (scanning).
    The directory name must be pointed to by  dirname  .
    The routine routines returns a KDir object on success, else it returns NULL
*/
/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

KFileInfo *dir_read (dir, skip_control)
/*  This routine will read (scan) a directory for files.
    The directory object must be given by  dir  .
    The value of  skip_control  determines whether or not to skip the special
    files: "." and "..". Legal values are:
        KDIR_DOT                  Pass ".", skip ".."
	KDIR_DOTDOT               Pass "..", skip "."
	KDIR_DOT_AND_DOTDOT       Pass "." and ".."
	KDIR_NO_DOTS              Skip "." and ".."
    The routine routines returns a pointer to a  KFileInfo  structure on
    success, else it returns NULL. The data in this structure is valid until
    the next call to  dir_read  or  dir_close  with this directory object.
