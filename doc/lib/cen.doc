/*  This file describes the cen_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide strong encryption for channel objects.

/*  [PURPOSE] This routine will register converter functions for a channel so
    that all IO will be encrypted using the IDEA cipher in Cipher Feed Back
    mode.
    <read_key> The 16 byte IDEA key used when reading.
    <read_init_vector> The 8 byte initialisation vector used when reading.
    <write_key> The 16 byte IDEA key used when writing.
    <write_init_vector> The 8 byte initialisation vector used when writing.
    <clear> If TRUE the keys and initialisation vectors will be cleared after
    use (highly recommended if they will not be needed again), irrespective of
    whether the routine fails.
    [RETURNS] A ChConverter object on success (which may be used in a call to
    ch_unregister_converter), else NULL.
