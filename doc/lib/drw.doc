    These routines are meant to provide a variety of drawing routines for
    XImage structures and data structures.

    The pixel values to use must be in the array pointed to by  pixel_values  .
    The data must be pointed to by  data  .
    The type of the element must be in  elem_type  .
    The conversion to be used for complex numbers must be in  conv_type  .
    The abscissa dimension descriptor must be pointed to by  abs_dim_desc  .
    The abscissa dimension stride of the elements in memory must be in
    abs_dim_stride  .
    The ordinate dimension descriptor must be pointed to by  ord_dim_desc  .
    The ordinate dimension stride of the elements in memory must be in
    ord_dim_stride  .
    The window scaling information must be pointed to by  win_scale  .
    The routine returns TRUE on success, else it returns FALSE.
