				Installing Karma
===============================================================================

1.0	Where to get the compressed tar files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Please see the README file for instructions on getting Karma.

  ALSO: read the README file for instructions on how to get on the mailing list
  This mailing list is VERY important.

1.1	What to do with the compressed tar files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The simplest way to install Karma is to ftp the binary distribution, rather
  than trying to compile it. If there is no binary distribution for the
  platform you want available, please Email a request to:
    karma-suggestions@atnf.csiro.au
  with details of you platform. You may be asked for an account on this
  platform so I can port Karma if it hasn't been ported yet.
  If you port it yourself, *please* Email me the details so that I can update
  the master version.

  The binary distribution tar files will create a directory  karma  which will
  contain appropriate sub-directories for binaries, libraries, include files
  and documentation.
  You should change directory to  /usr/local  and untar this. If you do not
  have system privilege or your local system administrator will not create a
  directory or symbolic link  /usr/local/karma  then you should get the source
  distribution and build it yourself.
  
  The source tar file will also create a directory  karma  which will contain
  the source tree. This should NOT be in the same directory in which a binary
  distribution is placed.

2.0	Setting up your  ~/.cshrc  and  ~/.login
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  With any distribution, you should have two files:
    karma/.cshrc
    karma/.login

  The  .cshrc  file should be sourced in a user's  ~/.cshrc  file in the
  following manner:

>- BEGIN-- sample code ---<
# Include Karma environment
if ("$?KARMABASE" != "0") then
    source $KARMABASE/.cshrc
endif
>- END-- sample code -----<

  The  .login  file should be sourced by the user's  ~/.login  file (or better
  still, the user should use the  setpath  script, which is available at
  CSIRO RP/AT).

2.1	Environment variables required
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These startup scripts require the definition of the  MACHINE_ARCH
  environment variable. This tells Karma makefiles what platform you are on.
  Legal values are:

    SUNsparc		Sun Sparc (Solaris 1.x, Solaris 2.x)
    convex		Convex (ConvexOS)
    rs6000		IBM rs6000 (AIX)
    dec			DEC Mips (Ultrix)
    SGImips		SGI Mips (IRIX)
    cray		Cray Y-MP (Unicos)
    VXMVX		Vicom VX/ MVX i860 accelerator(s) for Sun Sparc
    linux		IBM PC (Linux: free 386 Unix)
    MS_DOS_386		IBM PC 386 in 32 bit mode (MS-DOS)

  This environment variable is also used by the supplied  .login  script.

  At CSIRO RP/AT, the  MACHINE_ARCH  environment variable may be determined by
  the following in a user's  ~/.cshrc  file:

>- BEGIN-- sample code ---<
if ("$?MACHINE_ARCH" == "0") then
    if (-r /usr/local/csh_script/machine_type) then
	set _database_file = /usr/local/csh_script/machine_type
    else
	set _database_file = $HOME/csh_script/machine_type
    endif
    source $_database_file
endif
>- END-- sample code -----<

2.2	Environment variables produced
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The  .login  script will define a number of environment variables. Of
  particular note are:

    KARMABASE		root of the binary distribution for the platform
    KARMAROOT		root of the source distribution

  KARMABASE  is required at runtime by Karma modules in order to find some
  crucial database files. If this is not defined, the default  /usr/local/karma
  is used.
  Both environment variables are used when building a runtime version from the
  source code.
  If you are not building and installing a runtime (binary) version of Karma
  into  /usr/local/karma  you will need to edit the supplied  .login  to
  reflect the locations of the Karma source tree and runtime tree.

2.3	What you will need
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You will need access to GNU Make Version 3.64 or later in order to build the
  library.
  To produce dependencies for library source code and headers, you will need
  access to  makedepend  as shipped with the MIT X distribution, Version 11,
  Release 5.
  You will also need a C compiler.

2.4	Making a binary distribution directory tree
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You are strongly recommended to use a pre-built binary distribution rather
  than wasting effort doing it yourself.
  You will need the following directories (at least) under $KARMABASE:

    bin			where the executables go (should go in PATH)
    lib			where the libraries go
    lib/karma		where the makefile for the core Karma library goes
    lib/karma<*>	where the makefiles for the other Karma libraries go
    doc			where the documentation goes
    csh_script		C-shell scripts (should go in PATH)
    cm_script		Connection Management Tool scripts (should go in PATH)
    include		headers

  You should also place the  .cshrc  and  .login  files in this directory so
  users can source them.

3.0	Building a library
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The binary distributions come with the makefiles used to build the libraries.
  There are also template makefiles in the directory  source/lib/makefiles
  for a variety of platforms.
  Copy the appropriate template makefiles into the  lib/karma*/  directories.
  Use  GNUmakefile  as the filenames.
  If everything is set up properly, you should be able to type  gmake  (or
  gnumake  or  make) in each of these directories, and the libraries will be
  built.
  There should be a  Makefile  in  $KARMABASE/lib  which recursively makes in
  each library directory. Just type  make  in this directory.
