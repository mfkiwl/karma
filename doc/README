				Karma

	A Structured Package for Signal and Image Processing


	Karma is a package for signal and image processing applications. It
  contains KarmaLib (the structured libraries and API) and a large number of
  modules (applications) to perform many standard tasks.

  When files and directories are referred to, they are given relative to the
  root Karma directory (environment variable KARMABASE if defined). This is
  usually  /usr/local/karma
  Please see the file  INSTALL  for instructions on how to install Karma.

  The update policy for Karma is in the file  doc/update-policy

  The  doc/lib  directory contains documentation for the Karma libraries.

  The  doc/modules  directory contains documentation for the various Karma
  modules. This directory may be a little sparse...

  The  doc/howto  directory contains information on how to make good use of
  some of the more interesting packages in KarmaLib.

  The  doc/widgets  directory contains information on the Karma Widgets
  library. This directory may be a little sparse...

	Please mail any bug reports to:  karma-bugs@atnf.csiro.au
  No warranty, express or implied should be inferred by this mailing address.

	If you want to be added to the mailing list (to find out what's changed
  with Karma), please mail the request to:  karma-request@atnf.csiro.au
  This mailing list is VERY important: as bugs are fixed and enhancements made
  to Karma, this is your only way of finding out about these changes.

	If you have any suggestions for Karma, please mail them to:
  karma-suggestions@atnf.csiro.au

	Karma is available on anonymous ftp from:  ftp.atnf.csiro.au
  under the  pub/karma  directory. Both the source code and binary
  distributions are kept here. The source code is available free of charge.

  You are urged to get the binary distribution if possible, as this will save
  you the effort of building from source.
  When connecting to the ftp server, check the modification dates on the source
  distribution and the binary distribution. If the source distribution is newer
  than the binary distribution you want, this means that the binary
  distribution is out of date. Please send an Email a request to
  karma-suggestions@atnf.csiro.au  for a rebuilt version to be made available.
  I don't have local access to many machines, so I don't rebuild automatically
  for every platform.
