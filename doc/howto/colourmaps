This file is intended as a "getting-started" guide to dynamic pseudo
colourmap control in Karma. It should be used in conjuction with the
library reference documentation, which documents all the functions
available for colourmap manipulation.



Purpose:
--------

The dynamic pseudo colourmap control is intended to provide simple,
elegant and device independent control of colourmaps. Integrated into
the colourmap support is the ability to "share" colourmaps between
graphics applications on the same screen and between different
screens. For same-screen operation, this allows the user to
dynamically change the colourmap in one window, and have that appear
in another window at the same time. This is essential for image
comparison. With different screen operation, two or more users may be
viewing images on different consoles (perhaps across the planet), and
yet when one user changes the image colourmap, the other user(s) sees
this change as well. Any combination of same-screen and
different-screen operation may be employed. To make use of these
advanced facilities requires no extra code by the application
programmer: all this functionality is gained for free. Other features
of the colourmap support include the ability to register functions
which are called if a colourmap is resized, simple interfaces to
change colourmap parameters and colour palettes and the ability to
read and write colourmaps from/ to disc.
The colourmap support provided in the Karma library can save several
hundreds of lines of messy, intricate code.

The documentation on image display and communications support are
highly recommended.



Architecture:
-------------

The colourmap support in Karma is built on a layered approach, as
with many other sections of the library. The various packages in the
Karma library which provide colourmap support are listed below,
grouped by layer.


  Level 2
  =======

The  cf_  package provides a large number of colourmap types (or
palettes) which support the colourmap selection facility at a higher
level in the library. These routines have a very simple defined
interface, hence writing new colourmap functions is trivial.

The  xc_  package provides X11 colourmap support for higher levels of
the library.

The  vc_  package provides colourmap support for the Vicom VX board (a
Sun/VME board with an i860 and a 32 bit frame buffer).


  Level 4
  =======

The network support for colourmaps utilises the  conn_  communications
package. This means that connection management facilities are
applicable to the colourmap support.


  Level 5
  =======

The actual colourmap support is provided by the  kcmap_  package. This
package allows the programmer to create and manipulate dynamic pseudo
colourmaps using a generic interface. If network connections are set
up (using either the  conn_  package or the Connection Management
tool), manipulation of colourmaps is automatically transmitted across
the network. In addition to these features, colourmaps may be copied
to standard Karma data structures, and hence tranferred from/ to disc.
New colourmap functions are easily added. A large number of colourmap
functions are automatically available by default.
The  kcmap_  package registers support for two comminications
protocols:
"colourmap_indices"  for the sharing of colourmaps on the same screen,
"full_colourmap"  for the sharing of colourmaps on different screens.



Tutorial:
---------

Although the simple use of colourmaps is shown in the tutorials for
the image display support in Karma, it is worthwhile just pointing out
the ease with which colourmap support may be migrated from an X11
environment to, say, a VX display.

  Example 1
  =========

This example shows how to initialise the colourmap system for X11
support, and then create a colourmap.


/*----------------------------------------------------------*/
/*  Colourmap creation sample programme: X11 interface      */
/*----------------------------------------------------------*/

#include <karma.h>
#include <karma_kcmap.h>
#include <karma_xc.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>


#define DEFAULT_COLOURMAP_NAME "Greyscale1"
#define MAX_COLOURS (unsigned int) 200

Kcolourmap setup_cmap (dpy, window)
/*  This routine will create a Kcolourmap object from an X11 display.
    The X display must be given by  dpy  .
    The X window must be given by  window  .
    The routine returns a Kcolourmap object.
*/
Display *display;
Window window;
{
    /*  Declare variables  */
    Kdisplay dpy_handle;
    XWindowAttributes window_attributes;
    Kcolourmap cmap;

    /*  Get X colourmap ID  */
    XGetWindowAttributes (display, win, &window_attributes);
    /*  Initialise colourmap system  */
    dpy_handle = xc_get_dpy_handle (display, window_attributes.colormap);
    kcmap_init (xc_alloc_colours, xc_free_colours, xc_store_colours,
		xc_get_location);
    /*  Create Kcolourmap object  */
    cmap = kcmap_create (DEFAULT_COLOURMAP_NAME, MAX_COLOURS, TRUE,dpy_handle);
    return (cmap);
}   /*  End Function setup_cmap  */

  Example 2
  =========

This example shows how to initialise the colourmap system for a VX
display, and then create a colourmap.


/*----------------------------------------------------------*/
/*  Colourmap creation sample programme: VX interface       */
/*----------------------------------------------------------*/

#include <karma.h>
#include <karma_kcmap.h>
#include <karma_vc.h>


#define DEFAULT_COLOURMAP_NAME "Greyscale1"
#define MAX_COLOURS (unsigned int) 200

Kcolourmap setup_cmap ()
/*  This routine will create a Kcolourmap object from a VX display.
    The routine returns a Kcolourmap object.
*/
{
    /*  Declare variables  */
    Kdisplay dpy_handle;
    Kcolourmap cmap;

    /*  Initialise colourmap system  */
    dpy_handle = vc_get_dpy_handle ();
    kcmap_init (vc_alloc_colours, vc_free_colours, vc_store_colours,
		vc_get_location);
    /*  Create Kcolourmap object  */
    cmap = kcmap_create (DEFAULT_COLOURMAP_NAME, MAX_COLOURS, TRUE,dpy_handle);
    return (cmap);
}   /*  End Function setup_cmap  */

  Example 3
  =========

This example shows how to save a colourmap to a file.


/*----------------------------------------------------------*/
/*  Colourmap save routine:                                 */
/*----------------------------------------------------------*/

#include <karma.h>
#include <karma_kcmap.h>
#include <karma_ds.h>


flag write_cmap (cmap, file)
/*  This routine will write a Kcolourmap object to a file.
    The colourmap must be given by  cmap  .
    The filename must be pointed to by  file  .
    The routine returns TRUE on success, else it returns FALSE.
*/
Kcolourmap cmap;
char *file;
{
    multi_array *multi_desc;

    multi_desc = ds_alloc_multi (1);
    if (kcmap_copy_to_struct (cmap, (*multi_desc).headers, (*multi_desc).data)
        != TRUE) return (FALSE);
    return ( dsxfr_put_multi (multi_desc, file) );
}   /*  End Function write_cmap  */
