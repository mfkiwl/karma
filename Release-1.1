Subject: NEW PACKAGE for command line user interface
Date: Wed, 6 Oct 93 11:32:40 EST

SUMMARY:
  A new package (  panel_  ) to permit simple, uniform command line user
interfaces to be created is now available.

HEADER CREATED:
  karma_panel.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  panel_  package allows a module programmer to quickly and
easily implement a command line user interface. A user interacts with
a "panel", which contains a number of "panel items". Each panel item
may be a conventional parameter (ie. floating point number) or an
"action". The  panel_  package will process complete command lines and
will modify parameter values or perform actions as appropriate.

REASON:
  The previous command line user interface used in many Karma modules
was implemented by the  ez_decode  function. This is a routine that
was temporarily borrowed from the SIP package, and had a number of
limitations. The source code for this routine was not distributed with
the Karma library, hence almost all of the Karma modules were not
distributed in source form.
The  ez_decode  user interface required a preceeding '/' for each
parameter or function (action). This essentially precluded the
processing of files with a preceeding '/'. This is a major limitation
for Unix systems (  ez_decode  was designed for a VMS system: hence
the problem did not arise there).
The  panel_  package now supports all the basic Karma data types
(atomic elements and K_VSTRING and K_FSTRING), as well as an "action"
type (function). At a later date, new panel item types, such as arrays
of elements, will be supported, as well as (optional) limits on
numeric values. These changes will not need to break any existing
code, as the  panel_  package is using a varargs system to implement
attribute-value pairs of arguments.
Karma modules are currently in a transition phase. As time permits,
each modules is being upgraded to the new user interface. This means
that for a period of time, there will be some modules which still
require the preceeding '/' character.
As of now, the following modules have been upgraded:

fits2karma        merge_planes    collect_frames    conv_24to7
collect_struct    rx              tx

Subject: BUG FIX in  iedit_add_instruction
Date: Wed, 6 Oct 93 23:43:59 EST

SUMMARY:
  A bug in the  iedit_add_instruction  routine has been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  When a module added an edit instruction to a slave instruction list
using the  iedit_add_instruction  routine, the edit instruction was
deallocated before it was passed to the registered callback. This
resulted in some spurious results, typically detected as a programme
bug in  canvas_draw_edit_object  (for most modules).
This bug did not affect standalone or master edit lists.

Subject: NEW FUNCTION  kwin_convert_from_canvas_coord
Date: Fri, 15 Oct 93 15:07:09 EST

SUMMARY:
  A new function to convert from KPixCanvas co-ordinates to lower
level graphics system co-ordinates has been implemented.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_kwin.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  kwin_convert_from_canvas_coord  routine will convert a
KPixCanvas co-ordinate into a co-ordinate in the lower level graphics
system. In the case where the underlying graphics system is the X
window system, these co-ordinates will be X window co-ordinates.
This routine provides the inverse function of the routine:
kwin_convert_to_canvas_coord

Subject: BUGFIX in  ds_cmap_  routines
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 93 11:14:26 EST

SUMMARY:
  A bug in the  ds_cmap_  routines has been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  The ordering of colours in the data structure defined by the
ds_cmap_  routines was incompatible with other packages in the Karma
library (in particular, the  kcmap_  package). This could result in
swapped green and blue colour values when reading from disc.
Old files (written prior to this bugfix) may have incorrect colour
values. This can be corrected by the use of the  kdump  and  kgen
modules (and your favourite editor).

Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS for  kwin_  package
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 93 11:21:35 EST

SUMMARY:
  The following functions have been added to the  kwin_  package:
kwin_draw_string
kwin_draw_rectangle
kwin_fill_rectangle

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_kwin.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  kwin_draw_string  routine will draw a horizontal text string
onto a KPixCanvas object.
  The  kwin_draw_rectangle  routine will draw the outline of a rectangle
onto a KPixCanvas object.
  The  kwin_fill_rectangle  routine will draw a filled rectangle onto a
KPixCanvas object.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS for  canvas_  package
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 93 11:29:45 EST

SUMMARY:
  The following functions have been added to the  canvas_  package:
canvas_draw_point_p
canvas_draw_line_p
canvas_fill_ellipse_p
canvas_draw_rectangle
canvas_draw_rectangle_p
canvas_fill_rectangle
canvas_fill_rectangle_p

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_canvas.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  canvas_  routines with a trailing  _p  in their functions names
are similar to the routines without the  _p  except that they take a
pixel value as a parameter, rather than a K_DCOMPLEX value (which is
indexed into a Kcolourmap to obtain a pixel value).
  The  canvas_draw_rectangle  routine will draw the outline of a rectangle
onto a KWorldCanvas object.
  The  canvas_fill_rectangle  routine will draw a filled rectangle onto a
KWorldCanvas object.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION  cf_mirp
Date: Mon, 22 Nov 93 11:42:09 EST

SUMMARY:
  A new colourmap function  cf_mirp  has been added.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_cf.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  cf_mirp  colourmap function is yet another "favorite"
colourmap, submitted by Jeanne Young.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: BUG FIX in  kwin_  package
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 93 15:52:08 EST

SUMMARY:
  A bug in the  kwin_  package which could cause the process to abort
has been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  If allocating an XImage structure within  kwin_draw_image  failed, a
NULL pointer was passed to  xi_destroy_image  by  kwin_free_cache_data
This would cause  xi_destroy_image  to abort the process with a
message. A check for a NULL XImage pointer in  kwin_free_cache  data
has corrected this problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION  canvas_register_convert_func
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 93 15:56:59 EST

SUMMARY:
  A new function to modify the co-ordinate transformation between
pixel and world canvas co-ordinates has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_canvas.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  canvas_register_convert_func  will register a routine which
will perform pixel <-> world canvas co-ordinate transformations, in
place of the default co-ordinate transformation supplied by the
canvas_  package. This facilitates implementation of non Cartesian
co-ordinate systems in world canvases.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: BUG FIX in  viewimg_  package
Date: Tue, 23 Nov 93 16:01:01 EST

SUMMARY:
  Inaccurate conversion between pixel and world canvas co-ordinates
has been corrected.

DESCRIPTION:
  When a world canvas has an active viewable image associated with it,
the default pixel <-> world canvas co-ordinate transformation is no
longer valid. This problem becomes more noticable when a viewable
image is zoomed in. Using the  canvas_register_convert_func  a more
accurate co-ordinate transformation has been implemented.
