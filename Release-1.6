Subject: NEW FUNCTION <ds_format_unit>
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 11:44:38 +1100

SUMMARY:
  A new experimental function <ds_format_unit> has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ds.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <ds_format_unit> experimental function will format a unit string.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <ds_format_value>
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 11:48:57 +1100

SUMMARY:
  The experimental <ds_format_value> function scales and formats values.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ds.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The experimental <ds_format_value> function will apply a scale and
an offset to a value and will format the value into string in
human-friendly form.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <ds_get_data_scaling>
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 11:51:58 +1100

SUMMARY:
  The experimental <ds_get_data_scaling> function has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ds.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The experimental <ds_get_data_scaling> function will find the
scaling information for a data value in it's associated data
structure. Scaling information is used to convert data in integer
format to real-world units.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <viewimg_track_compute>
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 11:58:30 +1100

SUMMARY:
  The experimental <viewimg_track_compute> function has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_viewimg.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The experimental <viewimg_track_compute> function is a convenience
routine for implementing track windows. A standard position event
handler for the <viewimg> package simply passes many of the event
parameters to the <viewimg_track_compute> function and is returned
three formatted strings, containing pixel co-ordinates and data value,
world co-ordinates and "extra" information.

Subject: CHANGES to <TracePopup> widget
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:05:50 +1100

SUMMARY:
  The <TracePopup> widget now displays co-ordinates.

DESCRIPTION:
  The <TracePopup> widget now supports astronomical world co-ordinates
and displays the cursor position.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <ThreeDeeSlice> widget
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:15:07 +1100

SUMMARY:
  The <ThreeDeeSlice> widget has changed.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which uses the <XkwNcursorPosition> resource or receives
<XkwNcursorCallback> callbacks will need to be changed.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <Xkw/ThreeDeeSlice.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <ThreeDeeSlice> widget is now capable of displaying cubes which
are too large to show at 1:1 resolution. If a cube is too big then
each slice is automatically subsampled.

  The <XkwThreeDeeSliceSetCursor> function is now used to set the
current cursor position.

  The <ThreeDeeSlice> widget will display co-ordinate information as
the mouse is moved over any of the three slice windows.

REASON:
  The cursor resource and callbacks changes are designed to give
increased flexibility to applications which need to deal with
3-dimensional cursor positions. Cursor positions may now be specified
in data voxel index, linear or world co-ordinates. The cursor callback
provides cursor positions in all three co-ordinate systems.

Subject: NEW FUNCTION <viewimg_set_array_attributes>
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 12:16:40 +1100

SUMMARY:
  The <viewimg_set_array_attributes> function has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_viewimg.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <viewimg_set_array_attributes> function will set a variable
number of attributes on an array of ViewableImage objects. This allows
the setting of attributes en masse for a sequence of images.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <viewimg> package
Date: Sun, 10 Nov 1996 19:56:42 +1100

SUMMARY:
  New attributes for ViewableImage objects have been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_viewimg.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The VIEWIMG_VATT_DATA_SCALE attribute sets the default data
multiplier which may then be used by routines such as
<viewimg_track_compute> to convert integer image data to real-world
values.

  The VIEWIMG_VATT_DATA_OFFSET attribute sets the default data
offset which may then be used by routines such as
<viewimg_track_compute> to convert integer image data to real-world
values.

  The VIEWIMG_VATT_VALUE_MIN attribute allows a ViewableImage to
override the default KWorldCanvas minimum intensity value when it
is displayed. This allows canvas scaling to be associated with data.

  The VIEWIMG_VATT_VALUE_MAX attribute allows a ViewableImage to
override the default KWorldCanvas maximum intensity value when it
is displayed. This allows canvas scaling to be associated with data.

Subject: BUG FIX in <ds_copy_unique_named_element> routine
Date: 12-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <ds_copy_unique_named_element> routine has been fixed.

Subject: BUG FIX in <wcs> package
Date: 14-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <wcs_astro_*> routines have been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  The <wcs_astro_*> routines had a 0.5 pixel offset in the Digital Sky
Survey co-ordinate system support.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: BUG FIX in <mt> package
Date: 15-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <mt> package no longer fails with older Linux kernels.

DESCRIPTION:
  The <mt> package would fail on older with older Linux kernels, since
it depended on the newer format for /proc/cpuinfo (from kernel
2.0.0). Instead of aborting, the package now just displays a warning
message.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: BUG FIX in <wcs> package
Date: 20-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <wcs_astro_*> routines have been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  The <wcs_astro_*> routines did not deal properly with fields around
the north or south poles for the SIN, TAN, NCP and ARC projections.

Subject: CHANGES to <wcs> package
Date: 20-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <wcs_astro_transform> routine has been threaded.

DESCRIPTION:

significant speedsups (2x to 3x on a 4 CPU HyperSPARC 90 machine).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <SimpleSlider> widget
Date: 21-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <SimpleSlider> widget can now display scaled data.

DESCRIPTION:
  The <SimpleSlider> widget has a new routine
<XkwSimpleSliderSetScale> which will set the display scale for the
widget. The application has the choice of displaying integer, floating
point or both scales. The <XkwNscaledFormat> and <XkwNscaledUnit>
resources allow may be used to control the formatting and units for
the floating point data that is displayed.

  The <kwin_draw_pc_image> routine did not reliably determine RGB
values when redirecting from a TrueColour canvas to PostScript.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: BUG FIX in <iarray_get_sub_array_2D> routine
Date: 23-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_get_sub_array_2D> routine has been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_get_sub_array_2D> routine did not copy a crucial member
from the original array. Since this member was left uninitialised,
results were unpredictable.

Date: 27-NOV-1996

SUMMARY:
  The ZEA (Zenithal Equal Area) projection has been added.

DESCRIPTION:
