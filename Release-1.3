Subject: BUG FIXES in  kwin_  package
Date: Mon, 10 Apr 1995 00:42:17 +1000

SUMMARY:
  Various PostScript generation bugs in the  kwin_draw_image  routine
have been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  The first bug caused accesses past array bounds when input image
values lie outside the specified  z_min  and  z_max  values. This
could cause a segmentation fault.

  The second bug took the absolute value of input image values. This
would give incorrect PostScript when images contained negative values.

Subject: BUG FIXES in  dsrw_  package
Date: Mon, 10 Apr 1995 00:50:26 +1000

SUMMARY:
  Bugs when transferring non-byte complex values on little endian
machines have been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  When transferring data between host memory and a channel (i.e. disc
file or network connection), non-byte complex values were incorrectly
converted between the network data format and host data format. This
bug only affected little endian machines (e.g. i386 and alpha). All
data files written before this bug fix will contain erroneous complex
data. Use the  kdump  module to write out the data in ASCII format
prior to installing the bug fix and then  read the data in using the
kgen  module.
This bug was introduced after Karma v1.2 was released, hence this bug
has not appeared in any public release of Karma.

Subject: NEW PACKAGE for foreign data formats
Date: Tue, 18 Apr 1995 02:07:25 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The  foreign_  package allows a module to import from and export to
foreign data formats.

HEADER CREATED:
  karma_foreign.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_ppm_read> routine will read a PPM image file and
convert it to a Karma TrueColour image.

  The <foreign_ppm_write> routine will write a Karma TrueColour image
(or PseudoColour image with associated colourmap) in PPM image format.

  The <foreign_fits_read_header> routine will read in the header
component of a FITS data file and convert it to a Karma  multi_array
structure.

  The <foreign_fits_read_data> routine will read in the data
component of a FITS data file and convert it to a Karma  multi_array
structure.

  Other data formats will be supported in the future. Examples of
modules which use this package are:
    fits2karma    ppm2karma    karma2ppm

REASON:

  The  foreign_  package makes it easier to bring data into Karma
modules and export data from them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: BUG FIX in <imw_> package
Date: Thu, 20 Apr 1995 16:23:45 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <imw_origsize> routine could produce incorrect images.

DESCRIPTION:
   The <imw_origsize> was prone to integer overflow errors when
writing images of type K_INT. Overflow errors were likely to occurr
when displaying images with large values.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <foreign_guess_and_read>
Date: Sun, 23 Apr 1995 17:37:44 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <foreign_guess_and_read> routine reads files of many formats.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_guess_and_read> routine will attempt to determine the
format of a file (by inspecting it's filetype) and if the file is of a
known type, it attempts to read the file and yields a Karma data
structure. This may be used as a generic data read routine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <foreign_> package to support Sun rasterfiles
Date: 21-MAY-1995

SUMMARY:
  Support has been added to the <foreign_> package to allow Sun
rasterfiles to be read by Karma programmes.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_sunras_read> routine will read a Sun rasterfile image.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <foreign_> package to support Sun rasterfiles
Date: 22-MAY-1995

SUMMARY:
  Support has been added to the <foreign_> package to allow Sun
rasterfiles to be written by Karma programmes.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_sunras_write> routine will convert a Karma image to a
Sun rasterfile image.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <canvas_> package
Date: Tue, 29 Aug 1995 12:23:54 +1000

SUMMARY:
  Routines to manipulate world canvas attributes have been created.
Use of the <win_scale_type> structure is being phased out.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_canvas.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The <canvas_get_attributes> routine will get the attributes for a
world canvas. The <canvas_get_size> routine will be removed in Karma
version 2.0, as it uses the obsolete <win_scale_type> structure.

  The <canvas_set_attributes> routine will set attributes for a
world canvas. The <canvas_resize> routine will be removed in Karma
version 2.0, as it uses the obsolete <win_scale_type> structure.

REASON:
  The <win_scale_type> structure is being phased out because of
incompatibilities introduced when the structure has new fields added
to introduce new functionality. The use of attribute lists provides a
more stable and flexible interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <kcmap_> package
Date: Fri, 1 Sep 1995 09:25:36 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <kcmap_va_create> routine will replace the <kcmap_init> and
<kcmap_create> routines, which will be removed in Karma version 2.0.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_kcmap.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The <kcmap_va_create> routine will create a Kcolourmap object in a
similar fashion as the obsolete <kcmap_create> routine. However,
rather than requiring the use of <kcmap_init> to register the lower
graphics routines, <kcmap_va_create> takes these routines from the
parameter list.

  The <kcmap_init> and <kcmap_create> routines will be removed in
Karma version 2.0.

  It is intended that <kcmap_va_create> will be renamed to
<kcmap_create> in Karma version 3.0.

REASON:
  The existing system is designed for small (typically 8 bit)
PseudoColour colourmaps and only allows one colourmap type per module.
The <kcmap_va_create> routine can be upgraded in a compatible way to
support DirectColour colourmaps and software colourmaps for TrueColour
visuals. In addition the <kcmap_> package can now support multiple
colourmap types in the same module (i.e. PseudoColour and
DirectColour).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <kwin_> package
Date: 5-SEP-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <kwin_draw_pc_image> routine will replace the <kwin_draw_image>
routine.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which uses the <kwin_draw_image> should change to using the
<kwin_draw_pc_image> routine prior to version 2.0 of Karma being
released.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_kwin.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <kwin_draw_image> routine is deprecated and will be removed in
Karma version 2.0. The <kwin_draw_pc_image> routine provides the
existing functionality and more.

REASON:
  The <kwin_draw_image> routine did not provide support for intensity
scaling functions and did not have a convenient interface. The
<kwin_draw_pc_image> provides this extra functionality and has a more
logical interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <kwin_> package
Date: 18-SEP-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <kwin_> package has undergone a major internal restructuring to
facilitate support of different graphics systems. The incomplete
support for the VX display has been removed.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which uses the <kwin_> package needs to be recompiled.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_kwin.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <kwin_create_generic> routine provides the mechanism to create
pixel canvas objects for different graphics systems (i.e. X11, XGL,
OpenGL, etc.).

REASON:
  The planned support of XGL (for stereo display) requires a cleaner
separation between the generic pixel canvas support and graphics
system specific support.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <kwin_> package
Date: 22-SEP-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <kwin_> package now supports Sun Microsystems XGL graphics
library.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_kwin.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <kwin_xgl_create_stereo> routine provides the mechanism to create
stereo pixel canvas objects for XGL.

REASON:
  The Sun ZX video card can support stereo display, however, like
other vendors, they have not supported the Multi-Buffering X extension
but have opted to require one to use XGL. Similarly, to use stereo
hardware on SGI machines requires the use of OpenGL (which I also plan
to support at some point).
Stereo display support is of great benefit to volume rendering
applications, but one does not wish to programme with XGL directly!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <foreign_> package to support Miriad data
Date: 27-SEP-1995

SUMMARY:
  Support has been added to the <foreign_> package to allow Miriad
image (n-dimensional arrays) data files to be read by Karma
programmes.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_miriad_read_header> routine will read the header of a
Miriad Image file.
  The <foreign_miriad_read> routine will read an entire Miriad Image
file and convert to Karma format.
  The <foreign_miriad_test> routine will determine if a directory is a
Miriad Image file. This is required when adding support to directory
browsers.
  The <foreign_guess_and_read> routine has been modified to
automatically detect and read Miriad Image files.

REASON:
  Miriad is an important package used in the processing of radio
astronomy data. Adding Miriad Image file support allows visualisation
tools developed with Karma to work with Miriad data without the need
for any conversion to FITS format.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS for <ch_> package
Date: 27-SEP-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <ch_drain> and <ch_printf> routines have been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ch.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <ch_drain> routine will read and discard data from a channel.
  The <ch_printf> routine will write formatted output to a channel.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject NEW PACKAGE <dm_> for descriptor management
Date: 3-OCT-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <dm_> package provides event management for descriptors.

HEADER CREATED:
  <karma_dm.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <dm_> package provides event management for descriptors in a
similar fashion to the way the <chm_> package provides event
management for channel objects.

REASON:
  This package has been created to allow the <chm_> packages (and
similar packages for XT and XView environments) to be restructured,
allowing greater code sharing.
Currently this package is considered work in progress and may change
without notice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW PACKAGE <aa_> for Associative Arrays
Date: 14-OCT-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <aa_> package provides Associative Array support.

HEADER CREATED:
  <karma_aa.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <aa_> package simplifies the the management of lists of
key-value pairs. In many cases a list of names and their corresponding
objects needs to be maintained. The <aa_> package makes this task
simple.

REASON:
  While generally useful, the immediate requirement is in the
forthcoming volume rendering package.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW PACKAGE <col_> for colourspace conversion
Date: 29-DEC-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <col_> package provides routines to convert between different
colour spaces.

HEADER CREATED:
  <karma_col.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <col_hsb_slice_to_rgb_array> routine will compute a
2-dimensional array of RGB values from a slice in HSB (Hue, Saturation
and Brightness) colour space.

REASON:
  Converting between HSB and RGB colour spaces is required for a
hue-intensity display tool. Other conversions between different
colour spaces will also become useful.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW PACKAGE <wf_> for background processing
Date: 30-DEC-1995

SUMMARY:
  The <wf_> package provides background processing support.

HEADER CREATED:
  <karma_wf.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <wf_> package allows an application (or the library) to perform
background processing (by using work functions) while the application
is otherwise idle. Unlike using a threaded solution, work functions do
not compete with the main application for processing resources, and
hence do not interfere with the responsiveness of the application.

REASON:
  The new volume rendering package <vrender_> requires background
processing support.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW PACKAGE <vrender_> for volume rendering
Date: 3-JAN-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <vrender_> package provides support for volume rendering.

HEADER CREATED:
  <karma_vrender.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <vrender_> package provides most of the support required for
volume rendering. This includes geometry management and automatic
parallelisation for multiple processor platforms. The user interface
and shading algorithms are left as an exercise for the reader.

REASON:
  This package will facilitate programmers to develop new volume
rendering applications and shading algorithms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <canvas_> package
Date: 5-JAN-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <canvas_register_d_convert_func> routine will replace the
<canvas_register_convert_func> routine.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which uses the <canvas_register_convert_func> should change
to using the <canvas_register_d_convert_func> routine prior to version
2.0 of Karma being released.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_canvas.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <canvas_register_convert_func> routine is deprecated because it
passes co-ordinates through integer pointers. The
<canvas_register_d_convert_func> routine uses double precision
floating point numbers instead.

REASON:
  Greater numerical accuracy is required when drawing onto PostScript
Page objects.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <ds_> package
Date: 24-JAN-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <ds_find_1D_extremes> and <ds_find_2D_extremes> routines replace
the <ds_find_single_extremes> and <ds_find_plane_extremes> routines.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which makes use of the <ds_find_single_extremes> or
<ds_find_plane_extremes> routines should change over prior to Karma
version 2.0 being released.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ds.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <ds_find_single_extremes> and <ds_find_plane_extremes> routines
are deprecated.
The <ds_find_1D_extremes> and <ds_find_2D_extremes> routines provide
similar functionality.

REASON:
  The old routines have an awkward interface, do not support
non-contiguous data and are not MT-Safe. The new routines have a more
convenient interface, support non-contiguous data and are MT-Safe.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <mt_> package
Date: 24-JAN-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <mt_setlock> routine provides mutual exclusion locking support.
  The <mt_new_thread_info> and <mt_get_thread_info> routines provide
thread-private data.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_mt.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <mt_setlock> routine allows threads (jobs) to exclusively lock
resources. This provides for job synchronisation.
  The <mt_new_thread_info> and <mt_get_thread_info> routines allow
each thread to have a private working space (other than the stack)
which may be externally initialised prior to launching jobs and may
then be collated after all jobs have finished.

REASON:
  These routines increase the flexibility of the package, simplifing
the threading of more algorithms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <iarray_> package
Date: 24-JAN-1996

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_min_max> and <iarray_compute_histogram> routines have
been threaded.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_min_max> and <iarray_compute_histogram> routines will
now make use of multiple CPU platforms and hence run much faster
(about 3.7 times with a 4 CPU machine).

REASON:
  Obvious.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
