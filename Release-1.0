Subject: CHANGES to  iedit_  package
Date: Thu, 26 Aug 93 09:17:51 EST

SUMMARY:
  The function interfaces for the  iedit_  package have changed and a new
edit instruction callback mechanism has been implemented.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which makes reference to the  iedit_  routines must be changed.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_iedit.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  iedit_create_desc  routine has been renamed to
    iedit_get_instruction_desc  and the following routines have been created:
	iedit_create_list
	iedit_get_instruction_desc
	iedit_add_instruction
	iedit_remove_instructions
	iedit_apply_instructions
	iedit_get_list
  In addition, other routines have been removed or had their interface
definition changed.

REASON:
  These changes implement a major overhaul of the  iedit_  package which now
  supports a flexible callback mechanism to manage image edit instruction lists
  and mutual editing (communication of editing instructions).

Subject: BUG FIX in  dsrw_read_list
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 93 22:16:12 EST

SUMMARY:
  A bug in the  dsrw_read_list  has been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  The  dsrw_read_list  routine had a bug which would cause the process
to abort when reading a zero length list. This bug only manifested
itself on platforms with the network data format.

Subject: BUG FIX in  conn_attempt_connection
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 93 22:28:39 EST

SUMMARY:
  A bug in the  conn_attempt_connection  routine has been fixed.

DESCRIPTION:
  When a client makes a connection with  conn_attempt_connection  and
the server sends some initial data (within it's  open_func  callback),
the client  read_func  callback would not be called until control was
returned to the polling loop. However, due to the way connection
channels drain data from a descriptor into their read buffer, the
polling loop was not detecting an input event on the connection
channel (event detection is based on a level lower than channels).
Only if the channel read buffer could not absorb all the input data
would an input event be seen.
This resulted in the initial burst of data not being passed to the
connection read callback until the server sends more data at a later
time. This problem has been fixed by calling the read callback in
conn_attempt_connection  until the connection channel is drained.

Subject: CHANGES to  canvas_  and  viewimg_  packages
Date: Fri, 27 Aug 93 22:37:50 EST

SUMMARY:
  Some of the functions in the  canvas_  and  viewimg_  packages have
had parameters removed from their interface definitions.

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which makes reference to the  canvas_  and  viewimg_
routines which deal with drawing 2D edit instructions must be changed.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_canvas.h
  karma_viewimg.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The parameters relating to edit instruction list and edit coordinate
list descriptors have been removed from the function interface
definitions of these two packages. In some cases, these parameters
have been replaced by  KImageEditList  parameters.

REASON:
  This change is part of the recent overhaul of the  iedit_  package.
This simplfies the function interfaces for a number of routines.

Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS  iarray_put_named_string  and  iarray_get_named_string
Date: Sun, 5 Sep 93 23:38:27 EST

SUMMARY:
  Two new functions for attaching and extracting named strings to/
from Intelligent Arrays have been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_iarray.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The function  iarray_put_named_string  will attach a named variable
string element (type K_VSTRING) to an Intelligent Array.
The  iarray_get_named_string  may be used to extract this string at a
later date.

Subject: CHANGES to  conn_  package
Date: Sun, 5 Sep 93 23:48:31 EST

SUMMARY:
  The need for a protocols file has been removed.

DESCRIPTION:
  There is no longer a need to maintain a central protocols file in
order to co-ordinate protocol allocation. The file
$KARMABASE/etc/protocols may be deleted.

REASON:
  The previous implementation of the  conn_  package required a
protocols file to be maintained. Whenever a new protocol was required
by a package, module or application, the central protocols file needed
to be edited in order to allocate a protocol number. This was
inconvenient for applications programmers who did not have write
access to the protocols file. In addition, remote sites wishing to
establish connections needed to ensure that their protocols files
corresponded.
The internal implementation of  conn_  package has changed to avoid
the use of protocol numbers. Protocol negotiation is now based on the
actual protocol names.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS  in  iarray_  package
Date: Fri, 10 Sep 93 01:14:26 EST

SUMMARY:
  Two new functions for setting and getting world co-ordinates for
Intelligent Arrays have been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_iarray.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The function  iarray_set_world_coords  will set the world
co-ordinates (ie. minimum and maximum) for one dimension in an
Intelligent Array.
The function  iarray_get_world_coords  will extract the world
co-ordinates.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION  conn_register_cm_quiescent_func
Date: Mon, 27 Sep 93 11:21:07 EST

SUMMARY:
  A new function:  conn_register_cm_quiescent_func  has been created
which allows modules to wait for the Connection Management tool or
shell.

HEADER CHANGED:
  karma_conn.h

DESCRIPTION:
  The  conn_register_cm_quiescent_func  registers a callback function
which will be called when the Connection Management tool or shell has
finished setting up the initial list of modules and connections. This
would be useful when an application wishes to disable user input until
the Connection Management tool or shell is quiescent (ie. all
connections are established).
