Subject: BUG FIX in <kwin> package
Date: 18-JUL-1996

SUMMARY:
  Various drawing routines did not produce PostScript.

DESCRIPTION:
  Several drawing routines would continue to draw to the pixel canvas
rather than the PostScriptPage object when a PostScript refresh was in
progress. Hence some graphics objects would not appear in the
PostScript output.

Subject: CHANGES to <viewimg> package
Date: Thu, 18 Jul 1996 23:40:16 +1000

SUMMARY:
  An offset of half a data pixel has been added when drawing geometric
primitives.

DESCRIPTION:
  An offset of half a data value is now added when converting from
world to pixel co-ordinates. This means that a point drawn at the
co-ordinate for a data value will be drawn in the centre of the box
of pixels representing that data value, rather than the bottom-left
corner.

REASON:
  Generally, when drawing a point over a data pixel, it should be
placed in the centre of the pixel. Drawing a contour plot over an
image demonstrates this clearly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_contour>
Date: Fri, 19 Jul 1996 12:37:43 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_countour> routine extracts contours from an Intelligent Array.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_contour> routine will compute line segments that
approximate a set of specified countours. The co-ordinates of the
line segments are in linear world co-ordinates.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <canvas> package
Date: Sat, 20 Jul 1996 14:12:19 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <canvas_convert_from_canvas_coords> routine has been created. The
<canvas_convert_from_canvas_coord> has been deprecated.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_canvas.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <canvas_convert_from_canvas_coords> routine can convert many
co-ordinates in one call. The <canvas_convert_from_canvas_coord> can
only convert a single co-ordinate per call and hence is less
efficient. The <canvas_convert_from_canvas_coord> routine will be
removed in Karma v2.0.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES to <canvas> package
Date: Sat, 20 Jul 1996 16:43:45 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <canvas_register_coords_convert_func> has been created to
replace the <canvas_register_d_convert_func>

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_canvas.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <canvas_register_coords_convert_func> registers a routine which
can perform many co-ordinate conversions in one call, whereas a
routine registered with the <canvas_register_d_convert_func> routine
can only perform one conversion per call. Note that applications do
not normally register co-ordinate conversion routines since the
<viewimg> package does this.

REASON:
  Performing many co-ordinate conversions in one function call is much
more efficient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW PACKAGE <contour> for contour display
Date: Sat, 20 Jul 1996 22:56:25 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <contour> package adds support for displaying contour maps in a
similar fashion to the <viewimg> package.

HEADER CREATED:
  <karma_contour.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <contour> package allows the application to create a number of
KContourImage objects which may be displayed onto a KWorldCanvas. The
application can control which KContourImage is displayed, as well as
other attributes such as the colour the contours are drawn in, the
contour levels and so on.
As with the <viewimg> package, the application may create a single
KContourImage or a sequence of KContourImage objects from an
Intelligent Array with a single function call.

REASON:
  Contours maps are a useful alternative to greyscale images for the
display of 2-dimensional array data. By providing a package for
contour display with a similar interface to the <viewimg> package,
support for contour display modes can be easily added to existing
image display tools.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <viewimg_create_sequence_from_iarray>
Date: Mon, 22 Jul 1996 23:03:26 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <viewimg_create_sequence_from_iarray> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_viewimg.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <viewimg_create_sequence_from_iarray> routine creates a sequence
of ViewableImage objects from a 3-dimensional Intelligent Array.

REASON:
  Existing applications which create sequences of ViewableImage
objects use the <viewimg_create_sequence> routine, and must directly
access members in the private <iarray> structure. Since the contents
of this structure are subject to change, such accesses are not
guaranteed to work in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <contour_create_sequence_from_iarray>
Date: Mon, 22 Jul 1996 23:05:16 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <contour_create_sequence_from_iarray> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_contour.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <contour_create_sequence_from_iarray> routine creates a sequence
of KContourImage objects from a 3-dimensional Intelligent Array.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_create_from_template>
Date: Thu, 1 Aug 1996 00:18:34 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_create_from_template> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_create_from_template> routine will create an Intelligent
  Array of a specified type using an existing Intelligent Array as the
  template for the size, dimensionality and other attributes such as
  dimension names and world co-ordinates.

PURPOSE:
  This routine is intended to provide an easy way of creating an
  Intelligent Array which has exactly the same attributes as another,
  except for the type.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: CHANGES TO <ds> package
Date: Fri, 2 Aug 1996 11:21:24 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <ds_get_coordinate> routine has changed

CODE AFFECTED:
  All code which uses the <ds_get_coordinate> routine must be recompiled.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ds.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The type of the <<coord_num>> parameter to the <ds_get_coordinate>
  routine has changed from an integer to a floating point type.

REASON:
  Previously, it was not possible to use this routine to obtain world
  co-ordinates within the sub-pixel domain: co-ordinates were clipped
  to data pixel boundaries.
  This change allows the programmer to obtain world co-ordinates
  within the sub-pixel limit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_get_coordinate>
Date: Fri, 2 Aug 1996 11:29:29 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_get_coordinate> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_get_coordinate> routine will convert an index along a
  dimension of an Intelligent Array to a world co-ordinate.

REASON:
  Previously, many applications called <iarray_get_dim_desc> followed
  by <ds_get_coordinate>. This two-stage process is both inconvenient,
  and, for aliased sub-arrays (such as those obtained from
  <iarray_get_sub_array_2D>), this is incorrect, since the index along
  an Intelligent Array dimension is not the same as the index along a
  dimension descriptor.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_set_dim_name>
Date: Mon, 5 Aug 1996 18:29:45 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_set_dim_name> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_set_dim_name> routine will change the name of a
  specified dimension in an Intelligent Array.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <foreign_fits_write>
Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 17:09:51 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <foreign_fits_write> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_fits_write> routine will write a Karma data structure
  to a Channel object using the FITS format. The routine will
  automatically generate essential keywords such as: "NAXIS",
  "NAXISn", "CTYPEn", "CRVALn", "CRPIXn", "CDELTn", "BITPIX", "BUNIT",
  "BSCALE" and "BZERO". Also, existing keywords in the data structure
  which do not conflict with the generated keywords are copied.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <ds_history_append_string>
Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 18:42:51 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <ds_history_append_string> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_ds.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <ds_history_append_string> routine will append a history string
  to a multi_array data structure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_append_history_string>
Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 18:43:54 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_append_history_string> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_append_history_string> routine will append a history string
  to an Intelligent Array.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <foreign_fits_write_iarray>
Date: Tue, 6 Aug 1996 21:31:26 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <foreign_fits_write_iarray> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_fits_write_iarray> routine is similar to the
  <foreign_fits_write> routine, except that an Intelligent Array is
  expected, rather than the raw Karma data structure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS <foreign_miriad_write_iarray> and <foreign_miriad_write>
Date: Wed, 7 Aug 1996 17:54:06 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <foreign_miriad_write> and <foreign_miriad_write_iarray>
  routines have been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_miriad_write> routine will write a Karma data structure
  in Miriad Image file format. The routine will automatically generate
  essential keywords such as: "NAXIS", "NAXISn", "CTYPEn", "CRVALn",
  "CRPIXn", "CDELTn" and "BUNIT". Also, existing keywords in the data
  structure which do not conflict with the generated keywords are
  copied.
  Keywords in the Karma data structure must be in FITS-compatible
  units. Any necessary conversions to Miriad units are performed
  automatically.
  The <foreign_miriad_write_iarray> routine is similar to the
  <foreign_miriad_write> routine, except that an Intelligent Array is
  expected, rather than the raw Karma data structure.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTIONS <foreign_gipsy_write_iarray> and <foreign_gipsy_write>
Date: Thu, 8 Aug 1996 00:19:57 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <foreign_gipsy_write> and <foreign_gipsy_write_iarray>
  routines have been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_foreign.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <foreign_gipsy_write> routine will write a Karma data structure
  in GIPSY file format. The routine will automatically generate
  essential keywords such as: "NAXIS", "NAXISn", "CTYPEn", "CRVALn",
  "CRPIXn", "CDELTn" and "BUNIT". Also, existing keywords in the data
  structure which do not conflict with the generated keywords are
  copied.
  Keywords in the Karma data structure must be in FITS-compatible
  units.
  The <foreign_gipsy_write_iarray> routine is similar to the
  <foreign_gipsy_write> routine, except that an Intelligent Array is
  expected, rather than the raw Karma data structure.

Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_copy_named_element>
Date: Thu, 8 Aug 1996 18:02:24 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_copy_named_element> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_copy_named_element> routine will copy a named (attached)
  element (numeric value or string) from one Intelligent Array to
  another.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: NEW FUNCTION <iarray_get_fits_axis>
Date: Thu, 15 Aug 1996 17:20:28 +1000

SUMMARY:
  The <iarray_get_fits_axis> routine has been created.

HEADER CHANGED:
  <karma_iarray.h>

DESCRIPTION:
  The <iarray_get_fits_axis> routine will attempt to find the original
  FITS axis number of a dimension in an Intelligent Array. This makes
  the process of finding extra information associated with a dimension
  (such as reference co-ordinates) simple.
