$SUMMARY          Routines to manage callback lists
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a general purpose callback management
    framework. Library packages and applications may use this package to
    implement their own callback mechanisms. This package removes the need for
    external code to maintain and traverse callback lists.
