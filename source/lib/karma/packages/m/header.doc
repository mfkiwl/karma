$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate memory blocks
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a better memory allocation service
    than the malloc(3) call. The supplied allocation and deallocation routines
    perform periodic checks to see if array boundaries have been overrun.
    A set of memory manipulation and error message routines are also provided
    in this package.
