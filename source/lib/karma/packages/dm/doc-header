/*  Routines to manage events on (file) descriptors  */
/*  This file describes the dm_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a generic and simple to use descriptor
    management facility (ie. event processing on pipes, connections and
    terminals).
    NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS. THE INTERFACE MAY CHANGE IN THE
    NEXT RELEASE, POSSIBLY WITHOUT NOTICE.
