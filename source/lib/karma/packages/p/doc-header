/*  Low level routines to convert data  */
/*  This file describes the p_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a low level means of converting C data
    types to the "network" data format (ie. big endian, IEEE 754).
    These are memory to memory routines only. Although they are made public,
    their use is NOT recommended.
    When reading or writing raw data from and to files or connections, the pio_
    routines are suggested.
