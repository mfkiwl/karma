$SUMMARY          Low level routines to convert data
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a low level means of converting C data
    types to the "network" data format (ie. big endian, IEEE 754).
    These are memory to memory routines only. Although they are made public,
    their use is NOT recommended.
    When reading or writing raw data from and to files or connections, the
    <-pio-> routines are suggested.
