$SUMMARY          Routines to read and write a data structure from/to channels
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a mechanism to read and write the
    recursive, heirarchical data structure supported in Karma from and to
    open channels.
    The use of these routines is NOT recommended. The <-dsxfr-> routines are
    the preferred means of transferring data structures.
