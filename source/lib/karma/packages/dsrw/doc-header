/*  Routines to read and write a data structure from/ to an open channel  */
/*  This file describes the dsrw_ package of routines in the Karma
    library.

    These routines are meant to provide a mechanism to read and write the
    recursive, heirarchical data structure supported in Karma from and to
    open channels.
    The use of these routines is NOT recommended. The dsxfr_ routines are the
    preferred means of transferring data structures.
