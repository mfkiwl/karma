/*  Routines to manipulate channel objects  */
/*  This file describes the ch_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide an alternative to the standard C
    library streams (FILE *).
    The channel package provides far more powerful channels (streams),
    especially when transferring data over connections.
