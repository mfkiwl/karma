$SUMMARY          Routines to compute and write RGB colour values into arrays
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a VERY primitive mechanism to generate
    simple colourmaps. Although these routines are made public, their use is
    NOT recommended. The <-kcmap_-> package is the suggested means to create
    and manipulate colourmaps.
