/*  Routines to manipulate associative arrays  */
/*  This file describes the aa_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide general purpose associative array
    support. This can save a lot of code when you maintain lists of pairs of
    items (e.g. pairs of names and objects).
    NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS. THE INTERFACE MAY CHANGE IN THE
    NEXT RELEASE, POSSIBLY WITHOUT NOTICE.
