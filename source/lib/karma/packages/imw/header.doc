$SUMMARY          Routines to write raw images
$PURPOSE
    These routines provide a means to convert from image data to raw images
    suitable for low level graphics display. Although these routines are made
    public, their use is NOT recommended. The <-viewimg-> package is the
    suggested means to manage image display.
