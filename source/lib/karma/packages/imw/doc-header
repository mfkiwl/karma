/*  Routines to write raw images  */
/*  This file describes the imw_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines provide a means to convert from image data to raw images
    suitable for low level graphics display. Although these routines are made
    public, their use is NOT recommended. The viewimg_ package is the suggested
    means to manage image display.
