/*  Routines to convert and transfer host data to channel objects  */
/*  This file describes the pio_ package of routines in the Karma
    library.

    These routines are meant to provide a high level means of converting C data
    types to the "network" data format (ie. big endian, IEEE 754).
    These routines transfer data between host memory and files/ connections.
    These routines are NOT recommended as a means to transfer the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma, use the dsxfr_ routines
    instead.
