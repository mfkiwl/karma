$SUMMARY          Routines to convert and transfer host data to channel objects
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a high level means of converting C data
    types to the "network" data format (ie. big endian, IEEE 754).
    These routines transfer data between host memory and files/ connections.
    These routines are NOT recommended as a means to transfer the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma, use the <-dsxfr-> routines
    instead.
