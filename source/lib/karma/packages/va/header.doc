$SUMMARY          Routines to perform optimised vector arithmetic operations
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a suite of arithmetic operations on
    vectors (arrays) of data.
    These routines are highly optimised, with many inner loops coded in
    assembler to achieve sustained performance approaching (and in some cases
    equalling) the rated peak performance of the hardware.
    On some platforms, a speed improvment of over 30 times has been attained by
    coding in assembler.
