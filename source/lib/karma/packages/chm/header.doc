$SUMMARY          Routines to manage channel objects
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a generic and simple to use channel
    management facility (i.e. event processing on pipes, connections and
    terminals).
    A similar set of routines: chx_ provide identical functionality
    (with the exception of the polling routine), except that they rely on the
    Xt Intrinsics event dispatching system.
