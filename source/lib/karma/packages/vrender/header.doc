$SUMMARY          Routines to support volume rendering
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide support for volume rendering. Most of
    the hard work in setting up the geometry, projections and making use of
    multiple CPUs is done in the package. The application "just" needs to
    provide the user interface, display canvas and shading algorithms.
    NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS. THE INTERFACE MAY CHANGE IN THE
    NEXT RELEASE, POSSIBLY WITHOUT NOTICE.
