$SUMMARY          Routines to read an ASCII data structure from an open channel
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a mechanism to read the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma from open channels, in
    ASCII format.
    The use of these routines is NOT recommended. The <-dsxfr-> routines are
    the preferred means of transferring data structures.
