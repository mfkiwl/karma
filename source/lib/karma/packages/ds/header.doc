$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate the general data structure
$PURPOSE
    These routines provide the base functionality for the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma.
    This package both defines the (transparent) data structure and the various
    allocation, deallocation and manipulation routines.
    Transfer of data structures to/ from disc/ connections is supplied by the
    <-dsxfr-> routines.
