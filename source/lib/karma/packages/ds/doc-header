/*  Routines to manipulate the general data structure  */
/*  This file describes the ds_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines provide the base functionality for the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma.
    This package both defines the (transparent) data structure and the various
    allocation, deallocation and manipulation routines.
    Transfer of data structures to/ from disc/ connections is supplied by the
    dsxfr_ routines.
