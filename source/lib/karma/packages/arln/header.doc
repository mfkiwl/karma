$SUMMARY          Routines to asynchronously read from the standard input
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a simple to use asynchronous line
    reading facility. When reading from pipes, connections and terminals, the
    routines continue polling for events (using the chm_poll and cm_poll
    routines). They are not usable in a module which also uses an alternative
    event management scheme (such as Xt Intrinsics or the XView notifier).
