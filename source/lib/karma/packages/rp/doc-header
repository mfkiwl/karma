/*  Routines to manage cryptographically strong random pools of bytes  */
/*  This file describes the md_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide management of cryptographically strong
    random pools of bytes. Partially random data (entropy) may be added and
    extracted from a pool. As data is added, the pool is stirred to randomly
    distribute the bits. Data extracted from a random pool may be used in the
    generation of unpredictable (secure) session keys for cryptographic
    algorithms.
