$SUMMARY          Routines to manage cryptographically strong random pools
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide management of cryptographically strong
    random pools of bytes. Partially random data (entropy) may be added and
    extracted from a pool. As data is added, the pool is stirred to randomly
    distribute the bits. Data extracted from a random pool may be used in the
    generation of unpredictable (secure) session keys for cryptographic
    algorithms.
