/*  Routines to manage child processes  */
/*  This file describes the cm_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a generic and simple to use child
    process management facility.
    A similar set of routines: notify_cm_ provide identical functionality
    (with the exception of the polling routine), except that they rely on the
    XView notifier.
