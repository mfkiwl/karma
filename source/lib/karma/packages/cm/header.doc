$SUMMARY          Routines to manage child processes
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a generic and simple to use child
    process management facility.
    A similar set of routines: <-chx_-> provide identical functionality
    (with the exception of the polling routine), except that they rely on the
    Xt Intrinsics.
