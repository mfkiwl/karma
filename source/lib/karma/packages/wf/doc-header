/*  Routines to support work functions  */
/*  This file describes the wf_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide support for work functions. Work
    functions are similar to threads in that they allow background processing
    to be done, but require no threading support from the Operating System.
    Work functions are only executed while the application would otherwise be
    idle.
    NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS. THE INTERFACE MAY CHANGE IN THE
    NEXT RELEASE, POSSIBLY WITHOUT NOTICE.
