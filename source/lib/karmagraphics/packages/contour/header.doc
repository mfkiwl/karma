$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate contour images
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a high level mechanism to create and
    manipulate contour images (2-dimensional slices of Karma data structures).
    These contour images utilise the world canvases available in the
    <-canvas-> package, hence the resulting code is device independent.
    NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS. THE INTERFACE MAY CHANGE IN THE
    NEXT RELEASE, POSSIBLY WITHOUT NOTICE.
