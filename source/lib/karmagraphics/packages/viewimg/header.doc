$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate viewable images
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a high level mechanism to create and
    manipulate viewable images (2-dimensional slices of Karma data structures).
    These viewable images utilise the world canvases available in the
    <-canvas-> package, hence the resulting code is device independent.
