/*  Routines to manipulate viewable images in a device independent way  */
/*  This file describes the viewimg_ package of routines in the Karma
    library.

    These routines are meant to provide a high level mechanism to create and
    manipulate viewable images (2-dimensional slices of Karma data structures).
    These viewable images utilise the world canvases available in the  canvas_
    package, hence the resulting code is device independent.
