$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate 2-dimensional (image) overlay objects
$PURPOSE
    These routines provide a simple interface to the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma, to define 2-dimensional
    (image) overlay objects. In addition, all the mechanics for drawing onto
    world canvases (see the <-canvas-> package) is supplied automatically.
