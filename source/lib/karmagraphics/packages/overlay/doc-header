/*  Routines to manipulate 2-dimensional (image) overlay objects  */
/*  This file describes the overlay_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines provide a simple interface to the recursive,
    heirarchical data structure supported in Karma, to define 2-dimensional
    (image) overlay objects. In addition, all the mechanics for drawing onto
    world canvases (see the  canvas_  package) is supplied automatically.
