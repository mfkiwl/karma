$SUMMARY          Manipulate pixel canvases in a device independent way
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a high level mechanism to create and
    manipulate pixel canvases. After creating a pixel canvas from some graphics
    system primitive object, the canvas may be manipulated without the need to
    use the underlying graphics system interface. This renders code much more
    portable.
