$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate world canvases
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a high level mechanism to create and
    manipulate world canvases (canvases which have a co-ordinate system based
    on real-world co-ordinates). These canvases utilise the pixel canvases
    available in the <-kwin-> package, hence the resulting code is device
    independent.
