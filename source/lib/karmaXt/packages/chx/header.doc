$SUMMARY          Routines to manage channel objects using the Xt toolkit
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a generic and simple to use channel
    management facility (ie. event processing on pipes, connections and
    terminals). These routines rely on the Xt toolkit event handler.
    A similar set of routines: <-chm-> provide identical functionality
    (with the addition of the polling routine), except that they rely directly
    on Unix.
