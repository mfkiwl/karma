$SUMMARY          Routines to manipulate XImage structures
$PURPOSE
    These routines are meant to provide a more generic interface to the X
    Windows System XImage structures.
    These routines allow simple creation of standard and shared-memory XImage
    data structures, as well as the transmission of these to the X server.
