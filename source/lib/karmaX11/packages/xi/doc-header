/*  Routines to manipulate XImage structures  */
/*  This file describes the xi_ package of routines in the Karma library.

    These routines are meant to provide a more generic interface to the X
    Windows System XImage structures.
    These routines allow simple creation of standard and shared-memory XImage
    data structures, as well as the transmission of these to the X server.
