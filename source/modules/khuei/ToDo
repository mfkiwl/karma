	List of things to do and those done for the khuei module
	--------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
=====

FEATURE: Make use of Dataclip widget so that user can select range of
data values to map into huei/intensity ranges

FEATURE: Do not clear canvas when not needed (i.e. when a slider is
moved or a new file of the same size is loaded). Perhaps move over to
the <viewimg> package to save work

FEATURE: Properly deal with blank values (set unsigned 8 bit scaled
image to value 0)

FEATURE: Allow user to zoom in (and expand) on a region

FEATURE: Provide control so that user can choose to have images
smaller than canvas fill the canvas (perhaps should not be the default
since image expansion is an expensive operation and hence interactive
performance will be lost)

FEATURE: Allow user to view single image in intensity (useful when
interactively setting clip limits with the Dataclip widget)

FEATURE: Add PostScript output


DONE:
=====

BUG: loading "File 1" twice in a row or "File 2" twice in a row
(i.e. without loading the other file in between) causes a programme
bug which is noted in <iarray_dealloc>

FEATURE: Add support for Miriad files

FEATURE: Add colour wedge (probably 256*64)
