		Things I'm planning on putting into Karma
		=========================================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-OCT-1992

Add support for linear interpolation when zooming images.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5-OCT-1992

PostScript driver package. I want a package which will (at least)
convert a 2-dimensional image (Monochrome, Greyscale, PseudoColour and
TrueColour) into encapsulated PostScript. Maybe later I'll add the
drawing of axes and graphics overlays as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-JAN-1993

Volume rendering support package. The idea of this package is to tidy
up the existing volume rendering tools I have written. I have already
separated the ray casting (ray projection) from the ray processing
(shaders) in my applications. I'd like to write a library package that
performs the ray casting in a general way. You should be able to slot
in different projection algorithms as well as different shaders,
something akin to the way I allow different colourmap functions to be
slotted into the  kcmap_  package.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-JUL-1993

Axes display package. The current  ax_  package is built right onto X,
and dates back some years, and is not at all compatible with the Karma
graphics library.
The new axes package will be integrated into the world canvas package
(canvas_). The drawing of axes should just be automatic, easily turned
on and off with a flag.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21-AUG-1993

Virtual Canvas package. It would be nice to be able to draw all kinds
of things onto a canvas (with a world co-ordinate system, of course),
such as images and various geometric figures, and simply pan and zoom
this canvas. The virtual canvas would remember everything that was
drawn onto it (hm: what about removing stuff?), and when a pan or zoom
was requested, it would redraw the screen. Naturally, this would build
onto the existing image display support in the Karma graphics library.
However, I suspect that this will be *hard* to do properly. Is it
worth it? Is the exising system good enough?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20-NOV-1993

Graphics Overlay package. This will work in a similar fashion to the
iedit_  package (ie. lists of overlay instructions, adding
instructions to lists, callback functions, network integration, etc).
However, graphics overlays are not intended to modify data, they are
intended to be drawn over images and  iedit_  instructions. They will
be useful for putting annotations onto images, as well as being able
to draw, say, contours over an image from a remote module.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20-NOV-1993

Put start and stop frame sliders on the animation control for the
kmovie  module. Also a current frame number display and number of
frames display (or perhaps start and stop sliders will give this
anyway).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-DEC-1993

Put in support for image zooming in the  drw_  package (or in a new
generic package) using linear interpolation, smoothing kernels,
smoothing functions, etc. Don't want to be limited to just pixel
replication. Need some flexible way to specify smoothing operators so
applications programmers can experiment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9-DEC-1993

Move  iedit_  package over to a token passing system. This should
prevent deadlocks (such as when slave sends to master, master sends
first instruction back to slave, slave keeps sending and fills OS
buffers of master (which is no longer receiving), slave hangs).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11-DEC-1993

Add support for encrypted communications over channels. Key management
will probably be done by the  conn_  package. Have options for
checking netmask, so as to optionally encrypt over a LAN (default is
not to encrypt over a LAN, only encrypt when going off-site).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7-JUL-1994

Fixed routines in  conn_  package which transmit lower 32 bits of
connection pointer to CM tool. Not quite correct for 64 bit machines.
Should generate a proper ID.
